Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development

The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) has created a list of principles to aid organizations in dealing with people and organizations in different countries with different cultures. Just because speaking to a colleague in a certain manner is acceptable in one culture does not mean it is acceptable in other cultures.

Conduct an Internet search for the OECD to identify the nine principles it have adopted for IS security. Looking at those principles, create a table that documents where those nine principles fit into a company’s financial department. In other words, what would a company’s financial department have to do for each of the principles to ensure IS security by OECD’s standards? Make sure to include <em>at least</em> the following financial department responsibilities in the table:

<ol>

 <li>Payroll</li>

 <li>Paid time off</li>

 <li>Retirement plans</li>

 <li>Medical plans</li>

 <li>Accounts payable</li>

 <li>Accounts receivable</li>

 <li>Investments</li>

 <li>Loans</li>

 <li>Interacting with financial departments of other companies</li>

</ol>
